# ParkEase — Parking Slot Booking System

**IFQ636 Assessment 1.2 — Full-Stack CRUD Application with DevOps Practices**
**Student:** Naderian123
**GitHub Repo:** [kevlaspam/parkingapp_IFQ636](https://github.com/kevlaspam/parkingapp_IFQ636)

---

## Overview

**ParkEase** is a full-stack mobile-first web application that allows university students and staff to browse, book, manage, and cancel parking slots in real time. The system includes a user-facing mobile UI and a protected admin panel, backed by a RESTful API and a cloud-hosted MongoDB database.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React.js 18, React Router v6, Vanilla CSS |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas (cloud) via Mongoose |
| Auth | JSON Web Tokens (JWT) |
| Deployment | AWS EC2 (Ubuntu), PM2 process manager |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (automated build + deploy on push to `main`) |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |

---

## Development Workflow

The project follows a Git feature branch workflow to support collaborative development.

1. Create a dedicated feature branch.
2. Implement and test changes locally.
3. Commit changes using meaningful commit messages.
4. Push the feature branch to GitHub.
5. Create a Pull Request.
6. GitHub Actions automatically validates the build and tests.
7. Merge into the `main` branch following successful review and workflow completion.

This workflow helps maintain a stable production branch while enabling concurrent feature development.

## Features Implemented

### User Features (CRUD)
- ✅ **Register / Login** — JWT-based authentication with persistent session
- ✅ **Browse Available Slots** — Live list of available parking spots with location, price and status
- ✅ **Book a Slot** — Select date, start time, end time with live duration preview (Create)
- ✅ **View My Bookings** — See all active reservations with date, time, location and price (Read)
- ✅ **Reschedule a Booking** — Update start and end time on an existing booking (Update)
- ✅ **Cancel a Booking** — Delete a reservation, which frees up the slot (Delete)
- ✅ **Edit Profile** — Update name, email, university, and address

### Admin Features
- ✅ **View all parking slots** — See every slot in the system
- ✅ **Add new slots** — Create parking slots with number, location, price, and status
- ✅ **Edit slots** — Update slot details
- ✅ **Delete slots** — Remove slots from the system
- ✅ **View all bookings** — Admin-level overview of all user bookings
- ✅ **Database seeder** — Backend auto-seeds 10 parking slots on startup if the DB is empty

## Recent Improvements

Recent enhancements include:

- Added a booking summary screen before payment confirmation.
- Added a logout confirmation bottom sheet to reduce accidental logouts on mobile devices.
- Improved GitHub Actions workflow reliability through workflow permissions, concurrency control and execution timeouts.
- Enhanced deployment reliability using automated GitHub Actions and PM2 process management.

---

## UI Design

The UI is designed as a **mobile-first phone mockup** — a realistic smartphone frame rendered in the browser, including:
- Dynamic Island (camera pill)
- Status bar with live time, signal and battery icons
- Bottom tab navigation (Park, My Trips, Profile)
- Dark theme with violet (#7c3aed) accent
- Glassmorphism overlays, smooth animations
- Bottom sheet modals (contained inside the phone frame via CSS `transform: translateZ(0)`)
- Toast notifications replacing browser `alert()` dialogs

## CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

1. Checking out the repository.
2. Installing backend dependencies.
3. Executing backend Mocha/Chai unit tests.
4. Building the React frontend.
5. Uploading the frontend build as an artifact.
6. Connecting securely to the AWS EC2 instance using SSH.
7. Pulling the latest source code.
8. Updating environment variables.
9. Deploying the latest frontend build.
10. Restarting PM2 services.
